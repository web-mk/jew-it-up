      <p>Every Passover at the Seder table, we retell the story of our ancestors’ captivity in Egypt.  We recall their suffering, taste their tears in saltwater, and celebrate their miraculous journey to freedom.  But this year, that story resonates even more, as dozens of Jews remain captive in Gaza.


        </p><p>
          To honor the hostages, let’s fill their vacant seat by inviting a friend or relative who might otherwise not celebrate the holiday.  May their presence at our Seder table – and the message of freedom it inspires – bring about their safe return.  Because until every Jew is free, none of us are truly free.
