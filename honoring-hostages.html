      <h2>After 3,300 years,<br>
        they still won’t
        let our people go.
        </h2>

      <p>Every Passover at the Seder table, we retell the
        story of our ancestors’ captivity in Egypt. We 
        recall their suffering, taste their tears in saltwater, 
        and celebrate their miraculous journey to freedom.
        But this year, that story resonates even more, 
        as dozens of Jews remain captive in Gaza. 
        </p><p>
        This Pesach, as we open our doors for Elijah, let's 
        open our hearts to those who still await freedom. 
        May our celebration inspire hope, bring strength, 
        and hasten their return home. Because the Exodus 
        isn’t just our history—it’s our destiny. And until 
        every Jew is free, none of us are truly free.</p>
